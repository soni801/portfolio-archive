    <p>Hi! My name is Samuel, but I go by the name Soni online. I'm 17 years old, and currently in the second year of
        studying IT at Amalie Skram VGS in Bergen, Norway.</p>
    <p>I got introduced to programming in 2016 and did block programming for some months before learning web development.
        After some time I also learned Java. I now have knowledge in more than 10 programming, scripting and markup languages.</p>
    <p>My interests heavily revolve around computers and include programming, video editing, photography and color grading,
        music production and gaming. I also have interests and hobbies outside computers, like speedcubing.</p>
    <hr class="border-black w-28 m-auto opacity-40">
    <p>I've worked with web and general front end development for several years, with backend knowledge too. I have also
        done game design and development, in addition to a bit of graphic design.</p>
    <p>I can do frontend and backend web development, game development, mobile and desktop app design and development,
        logo design, general branding, color grading and video editing. If you want to discuss a business opportunity,
        feel free to <a href="mailto:soni@recalstudios.net" class="underline">contact me</a>.</p>
