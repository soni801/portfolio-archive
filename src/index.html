            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Samuel, but I go by the name Soni online. I'm currently in the second year of studying IT at Amalie Skram VGS in Bergen, Norway.</p>
            <p>I got introduced to programming in 2016 and did block programming for some months before learning web development. After some time I also learned Java. I now have knowledge in several programming, scripting and markup languages.</p>
            <p>My interests heavily revolve around computers and include stuff like programming, video editing, photography and color grading, music production and gaming. I also have interests and hobbies outside computers, like speedcubing.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I've worked with web and front end development for several years, with additional backend knowledge. I have also done game design and development, in addition to a bit of graphic design.</p>
            <p>I can do frontend and backend web development, game development, mobile and desktop app design and development, logo design, general branding, color grading and video editing. If you want to discuss a business opportunity, feel free to contact me.</p>
